#Burger Buddy Problem
project1 of Operating System in SJTU

There's serval racks where cooks can put burgers on, cashiers take orders from customers, and take one burger from the rack.
Cooks keeping making burgers until the rack is full, cashiers will sleep when there is no customers, if all costumers has left, cashiers and cooks will leave.

customers, cooks, cashiers are simulated with serval threads.
